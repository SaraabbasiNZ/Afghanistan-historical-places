## Design

### Imagery
The design of this project focuses on using compelling and high-quality imagery to visually immerse users in the historical beauty and significance of Afghanistan's historical places. Carefully selected images complement the content, providing users with a captivating and informative visual experience. 

### Colors
The website's color scheme employs a combination of white and light gray, with subtle accents of dark gray, harmonizing with the natural imagery. The landing page features a white smoke font color against a light gray background, enhancing the visual appeal for exploration and reading. On subsequent pages, a white background with black font ensures optimal readability and user comfort. 

### Fonts
The Oswald font is the main font used throughout the whole website. This font was imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I'm using Sans Serif as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

        - [W3C Validator Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)
- #### CSS
    - No errors were found when passing through the official W3C CSS Validator 
        - [W3C CSS Validator Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)

### Form Testing
- The form has been tested to ensure it would not submit without the required input fields being filled in (full name and email address).

### Links Testing
- All navigation links were tested manually to ensure the user is directed to the correct section of the website.
- Learn more button links of the first page were tested manually to ensure they direct the user to the correct page. 

### Browser Testing
- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari browsers with no issues noted.
    
### Device Testing
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone 8, iPhoneX and iPad to ensure responsiveness on various screen sizes. The website performed as intended. The responsive design was also checked using Chrome developer tools across multiple devices with structural integrity holding for the various sizes.
- I also used the following websites to test responsiveness:
    - [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faliokeeffe.github.io%2Fmindyoga%2F)
    - [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faliokeeffe.github.io%2Fmindyoga%2F)

### Friends and Family User Testing
Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Fixed Bugs
#### Navbar on Smaller Devices
In the header element, there are anchor links for users to navigate to different sections on the website. However, when viewed on smaller devices, the logo became unreadable because the other three pages had a white background. To address this issue, we applied a code to change the navbar's background color to gray on smaller devices, ensuring that the logo is legible on all pages.
#### Feedback page on Smaller Devices
The feedback page had an issue with its code. When viewed on a smaller device, the menu bar and the feedback form appeared side by side, which was far from ideal. To rectify this, with the assistance of my mentor, we implemented the following code adjustments: z-index: -1, position: relative, and margin-top: 80px. This resolved the problem so that when clicking the menu bar, only the menu bar is displayed without interfering with the form.
